## [Unreleased]

## [3.4.1] - 2022-05-13
### Fixed
- Updated to correct Nakama .NET 3.4.0 release binary.

## [3.4.0] - 2022-05-02
### Changed
- Update to use Nakama .NET 3.4.0 release.

## [3.3.0] - 2022-01-25

### Added
- Add additional group listing filters.

### Fixed
- Fix url-safe encoding of query params that were passed to the client as arrays of strings.

## [3.1.1] - 2021-08-11
### Changed
- Remove `autoRefreshSession` from overloaded `Client` constructors. This can still be customized with the base `Client` constructor. This is a workaround for an internal compiler error in Unity's WebGL toolchain.

### Fixed
- Remove use of deprecated WWW fields in newer versions of Unity.

## [3.1.0] - 2021-08-11
### Added
- Add ability for user to retry requests if they fail due to a transient network error.
- Add ability for user to cancel requests that are in-flight.

## [3.0.0] - 2021-07-14
### Added
- The language tag for the user can be configured with the socket on connect.

### Changed
- An `IPartyMatchmakerTicket` is now received by the party leader when they add their party to the matchmaker via `AddMatchmakerPartyAsync`.
- Renamed `PromotePartyMember` to `PromotePartyMemberAsync`.

## [2.9.5] - 06-18-21
### Fixed
- Fix issue where UnityLogger did not implement a Debug log method.

## [2.9.4] - 06-17-21
### Fixed
- Fix issue where refreshing a session with metadata threw an exception due to the key already existing.

## [2.9.3] - 05-21-21
### Fixed
- Fix issue where `IUserPresence` objects were not being deserialized properly by the client as part of the `IParty` object.

## [2.9.2] 05-19-21
### Added
- The `Socket.ReceivedParty` event can now be subscribed to in order to listen for acceptance events from the leader of a closed party.

## [2.9.1] 05-18-21
### Fixed
- Fix incorrect .DLL version being pulled in from nakama-dotnet.

## [2.9.0] 05-17-21

### Added
- A session can be refreshed on demand with "SessionRefreshAsync" method.
- Session and/or refresh tokens can now be disabled with a client logout.
- The client now supports session auto-refresh using refresh tokens. This is enabled by default.
- New socket RPC and MatchSend methods using ArraySegment to allow developers to manage memory re-use.
- Add IAP validation APIs for purchase receipts with Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and Huawei AppGallery.
- Add Realtime Parties feature.

### Changed
- Use lock object with socket operations instead of ConcurrentDictionary as a workaround for a Unity engine WebGL regression.
- Avoid use of extension methods as a workaround for a Unity engine WebGL regression.
- Unity sockets now dispatch events on Unity's main thread by default. If you have been using code to move socket message to the main thread (e.g., UnityMainThreadDispatcher) you may now remove that code. This new default behavior can overridden by passing `useMainThread: false` to `client.NewSocket`. When passed this way, sockets default to their pre-2.9 behavior by dispatching messages in a separate thread.

### Fixed
- Parse HTTP responses defensively in case of bad load balancer configurations.

## [2.8.1] - 2021-03-16
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug with parsing error responses that did not contain a message or grpc code.
### Changed
- Made names of asmdef files more specific for easier searching inside the Unity editor.

### Changed
- Listing tournaments can now be done without providing start or end time filters.
- Can now import Steam friends after authenticating or linking to a Steam account.
